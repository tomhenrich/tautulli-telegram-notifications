## Tautulli notification templates, in order to inform you about any Plex library changes through a Telegram channel or group.

Each of them should be added in the Notification Agents settings. 
First of all, you need to get some easy Telegram info:

* Get a new token, contacting with [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather "@BotFather Telegram bot")
* Get a new Telegram Chat ID, Group ID, or Channel Username, contacting with [@myidbot](https://telegram.me/myidbot "@myidbot Telegram bot")

Once you get them, fill in the blur fields:
